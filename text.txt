Hard-coded wireless device names in scripts? Well that's no fun. Fortunately, it's not too difficult to change the interface name.

Create a file as root named: /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
Add this:
SUBSYSTEM=="net", ACTION=="add", DRIVERS=="?*", ATTR{address}=="00:01:02:03:04:05", ATTR{dev_id}=="0x0", ATTR{type}=="1", NAME="wlan0"
Reboot
Be sure to change 00:01:02:03:04:05 to the proper MAC address of your wireless device. This should give you what you need.
